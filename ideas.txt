Operators and operands

All blocks are operands, unless fixed to the ground
Blocks may be operators (transform) or requirements (t/f)

Operations change the position of operands
Requirements evaluate to true or false

A level is beaten when all requirements evaluate to true

A single operand can be selected (left click)
An arbitrary number of operators can be selected (left click)
Operations applied after selection complete (right click)

Operators

Vacuous
    No movement

Translate
    Single orthogonal movement
    Global, possibly less constrained/interesting
        May equate to WASD
        Start with arrows of single direction

Leapfrog
    Move across operator

Reflect
    Reflect about operator

Rotate
    Rotate about operator?
    Rotate in place?

Swap
    Operand and operator change places

Shoot

Copy


Requirements

No orthogonal
Touching n

All orthogonal, no orthogonal, n orthogonal
n adjacent




Meta-selection?
Execution blocks?

Operators where the relative positions of the operand and operator don't matter are perhaps less interesting
Requirements that are global are perhaps less interesting

Modifier
    Modifies the next operator?
    x2, x3, etc
